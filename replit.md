# Overview

This project is a comprehensive WhatsApp bot application called "Gawr Gura Bot" - a feature-rich messaging bot with a modern web dashboard for management and monitoring. The application provides real-time chat capabilities, command management, user analytics, and administrative controls through a sleek React-based interface with an Express.js backend.

The bot includes advanced features like interactive games (trivia), sticker generation, user leveling systems, and comprehensive analytics. The dashboard allows administrators to monitor bot performance, manage commands, view chat activity, and handle bot connectivity through QR code or PIN-based authentication.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client uses React with TypeScript and is built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. The UI framework is based on shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives, providing a consistent and accessible design system. The application uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing and TanStack Query for efficient server state management with real-time updates.

The styling approach combines Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom CSS variables for theming. The design implements a marine/ocean theme with custom gradients and animations to match the "Gawr Gura" shark character branding.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js and TypeScript, implementing a RESTful API architecture. The application uses a modular route structure with WebSocket support for real-time features like live chat updates and bot status monitoring. The server includes comprehensive logging middleware and error handling for production reliability.

The storage layer is abstracted through an interface-based design (`IStorage`) with both in-memory and database implementations. This allows for flexible deployment options and easy testing with mock data.

## Database Design
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The schema includes tables for users, groups, messages, commands, statistics, and bot status tracking. The database configuration uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalable cloud deployment.

Key entities include:
- Users with leveling and experience systems
- Groups with customizable settings
- Messages with metadata for different content types
- Commands with usage tracking
- Daily statistics for analytics
- Bot status for connectivity monitoring

## Real-time Communication
WebSocket implementation provides real-time updates for chat messages, bot status changes, and system notifications. The client automatically reconnects on connection loss and handles various message types for different bot events.

## Authentication & Bot Integration
The application supports multiple WhatsApp connection methods including QR code scanning and PIN-based authentication. The bot status is continuously monitored with automatic reconnection capabilities and comprehensive error handling.

## State Management
The frontend uses TanStack Query for server state management with optimistic updates and automatic background synchronization. Local component state is managed with React hooks, while global UI state (like toasts and modals) uses context providers.
